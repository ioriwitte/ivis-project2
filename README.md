# ivis-project2

This is the Project 2 for Information Visualization course in KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

The aim of the project is try to visualizing the world through its own worldview with data from World Value Survey by using D3.js.

Here is the running website for this project: http://people.kth.se/~zhihaoy/ivis-project2/index.html

Below is the project requirements.

____________________________________


You have been hired as an Online Visualization Engineer by the World Values Survey. Congratulations!
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp

Read about it. What is it? What type of data do they show?
Learn to use their visualization tools.
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp

You create and document (text and images) an analytic trail, that is the story of your analysis, from exploration to conclusions, including data processing, visual mappings, visual structures, view transformations, and acquired insights. Then you give your colleagues a brief and constructive presentation with criticism to the WVS tools focusing on their limitations. Remember, perhaps one of your new colleagues or bosses created them, so be positive and constructive. It has been hard work for decades to get here and there are (hopefully) good reasons why they hired you.

At this point, you decide to use D3 (Data Driven Documents) http://d3js.org/ to significantly improve the visualization tools of the WVS. You ask yourself: Can you visualize multiple variables at once? Can you contextualize them in their geographical locations and still provide focus on individual variables? Can you show long-term periods of evolving world values?

Next, to show off your skills to your new bosses, you decide to combine WVS data with the open data from Gapminder http://www.gapminder.org/ for the countries that have data from both sources. You are careful not to get too much data that is difficult to pair up. But now you are able to put your code where your mouth is. You backup your previous criticism with actual working visualizations that show insight beyond the limitations of the original tools. You are immediately promoted. Congratulations again!

Your boss asks you to create and document (text and images) a new analytic trail that goes deeper into your research questions.

You decide to create a URL (webpage with a permanent link) with the running d3 code, images, and text describing your research questions, the two analytic trails, the results, and your learning in under 300 words.
