Congratulations!\r\nhttp://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp\r\n\r\nRead about it. What is it? What type of data do they show?\r\nLearn to use their visualization tools.\r\nhttp://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp\r\n\r\nYou create and document (text and images) an analytic trail, that is the story of your analysis, from exploration to conclusions, including data processing, visual mappings, visual structures, view transformations, and acquired insights. Then you give your colleagues a brief and constructive presentation with criticism to the WVS tools focusing on their limitations. Remember, perhaps one of your new colleagues or bosses created them, so be positive and constructive. It has been hard work for decades to get here and there are (hopefully) good reasons why they hired you.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you decide to use D3 (Data Driven Documents) http://d3js.org/ to significantly improve the visualization tools of the WVS. You ask yourself: Can you visualize multiple variables at once? Can you contextualize them in their geographical locations and still provide focus on individual variables? Can you show long-term periods of evolving world values?\r\n\r\nNext, to show off your skills to your new bosses, you decide to combine WVS data with the open data from Gapminder http://www.gapminder.org/ for the countries that have data from both sources. You are careful not to get too much data that is difficult to pair up. But now you are able to put your code where your mouth is. You backup your previous criticism with actual working visualizations that show insight beyond the limitations of the original tools. You are immediately promoted. Congratulations again!\r\n\r\nYour boss asks you to create and document (text and images) a new analytic trail that goes deeper into your research questions.\r\n\r\nYou decide to create a URL (webpage with a permanent link) with the running d3 code, images, and text describing your research questions, the two analytic trails, the results, and your learning in under 300 words. \r\n\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nCode Reference:\r\n\r\nObject constancy with multiple sets of time-series: http://bl.ocks.org/nsonnad/4175202\r\n",
